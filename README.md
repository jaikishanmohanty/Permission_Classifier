In this project, we present methods for real-time Android application malware detection. 
* First, we install an application to collect all permissions of the installed application in a device for further analysis. 
* We then pre-process the dataset and remove all system permission which is already added to the dataset list. 
* Next, we determine the rating based on how frequently the permission is used for the selected application category. 
* Then the filtered data is applied to our trained Decision tree and Random forest model which is trained from 2 million Google application datasets. 

Furthermore, the machine learning algorithm parsed and classified the permission as safe or unsafe using a classifier. The entire technology was used on real-world malware and benign application samples


## Built With

* ML model built using Python 3.11.4
* Android apk using Java
